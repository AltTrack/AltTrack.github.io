# AltTrack - Track Alt Coins

I needed a simple minimalistic cryptocurrency tracker that I can throw up on a monitor with a super easy interface.

## Getting Started

Simply head to [alttrack.github.io](https://alttrack.github.io/) or fork this project. Once you're there, select the coins that you're most interested in and click next.

On your dashboard you can see a simple view of each coin and their value in USD and Bitcoin (You can change bitcoin comparison to ether or another coin from the settings page). If you want to see the value of your current portfolio, simply click My Portfolio and add your personal holdings (Note that this is held in localStorage).

## Built With

* [VueJs](vuejs.org) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [Vue Resource](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource) - The HTTP client for Vue.js
* [Store2](https://github.com/nbubna/store) - A better way to use localStorage and sessionStorage
